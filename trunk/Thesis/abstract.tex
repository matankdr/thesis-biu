\Abstract{ 
Frontier-based exploration is the most common approach to exploration, a
fundamental problem in robotics. In frontier-based exploration, robots
explore by repeatedly computing (and moving towards) \emph{frontiers},
the segments which separate the known regions from those unknown. However, most
frontier detection algorithms process the entire map data. This can be a time
consuming process which slows down the exploration. In this thesis, we present
two novel frontier detection algorithms: \WFD, a graph search based
algorithm and \FFD, which is based on processing only the
new laser readings data. In contrast to state-of-the-art methods, both
algorithms do not process the entire map data. 
This thesis contains a theoretical complexity analysis for both algorithms and
since \FFD is a novel approach, we proove its correctness. We succeeded to
improve \WFD and \FFD performance even further by combining them into two new algorithms called \WFDINC and \WFDIP.
We implemented all algorithms and showed that all are faster than a
state-of-the-art frontier detector implementation (by several orders of magnitude).
