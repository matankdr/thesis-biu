              only
              \begin{itemize}
                \item rather than entire regions of the map
              \end{itemize}
              \item \textbf{Problem}: previously detected frontiers are not
              updated during navigation
              \begin{itemize}
              	\item only the frontier that the robot is headed to
              \end{itemize}
              \item \textbf{Solution}: maintaining frontiers which are not
              covered in the sensors range
              \item \emph{FFD} has to run in the background
               \begin{itemize}
                 \item in contrast to other approaches that are executed in a
                 certain time
               \end{itemize}

              changes

	                \item caused by loop-closures

					\begin{itemize}
					  \item Thanks go to Kai M. Wurm and Wolfram Burgard
					\end{itemize}

                \newline [Grisetti, Stachniss and Burgard (2007)]
                \item We used several environments taken from RADISH
                [Howard and Roy (2003)]
                \item We use raw sensor readings and odometry:
                	\begin{itemize}
                	  \item All algorithms use exactly the same data
                	  \item All algorithms form the same robot trajectories
                	  \item The movement of the robot is identical
                	  \item The only thing we examine is how quickly it can compute
                	  frontiers

			  real-time frontier detection
