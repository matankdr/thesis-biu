	abstract = {10.1177/0278364910373409 In this paper we address the problem of classifying objects in urban environments based on laser and vision data. We propose a framework based on Conditional Random Fields {(CRFs),} a flexible modeling tool allowing spatial and temporal correlations between laser returns to be represented. Visual features extracted from color imagery as well as shape features extracted from {2D} laser scans are integrated in the estimation process. The paper contains the following novel developments: (1) a probabilistic formulation for the problem of exploiting spatial and temporal dependencies to improve classification; (2) three methods for classification in {2D} semantic maps; (3) a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm to train {CRFs} from partially labeled data; (4) the combination of local classifiers with {CRFs} to perform feature selection on high-dimensional feature vectors. The system is extensively evaluated on two different datasets acquired in two different cities with different sensors. An accuracy of 91\% is achieved on a seven-class problem. The classifier is also applied to the generation of a 3 km long semantic map.},
